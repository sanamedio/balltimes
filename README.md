# balltimes
Early on the pandemic the NY Times had an article with a widget in it that showed balls bouncing around and infecting each other.
I thought it was really clever and I was left with many questions:
What if some balls didnt move, or spent more time around the same balls, what if they where was more space or if they where really packed...
The ideas are many.
So I figured I could answer some, I made it run and answered some and forgot about it.
I now set out to make something out of it that other people could use to explain their ideas visually and in a more agreable way.
I want it to be a tool, and I want it to record statistics of all kinds that can be used to explain trends.
For that purpose I intend to keep the movement of all balls equal or record any changes to it.
Also I wanted the ball interactions to be as real as they could be without afecting speed, and the balls to be able to take all posible routes, and not limit them to finite set of angles.
I want to make diferent kinds of balls that will have diferent properties share a board and add as many editable configurations as I can manage.
